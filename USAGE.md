# Detect duplicated classes in CLASSPATH

Sometimes, some jars include 3rd party dependencies embedded, or the same jar can be found under different organizations.  

If there are 2 different implementations of the same class in the same JVM, it is random which one will be used, and this can produce nasty bugs like it works in my computer but not in yours.

Use the `checkDuplicatedDependencies` task for detecting it.

It will fail and provide a list of all incompatibilities, in case it finds the same class in 2 different jars.

If the same class is duplicated, but it's the same implementation, it won't complain.

This is detected by computing a MD5 hash of the contents of the file.

If you consider the found conflicts are inoffensive, in order to ignore them in a future run, use the `checkDuplicateExclude` setting.  The value of this setting is automatically given.

Here is an example of report:

If you consider these conflicts are inoffensive, in order to ignore them, use:
set checkDuplicatedExclude := Seq(

  "commons-collections" % "commons-collections" % "3.2.1" -> "commons-beanutils" % "commons-beanutils-core" % "1.7.0",

  "xerces" % "xercesImpl" % "2.9.1" -> "org.python" % "jython-standalone" % "2.5.2",
  "commons-collections" % "commons-collections" % "3.2.1" -> "commons-beanutils" % "commons-beanutils" % "1.8.3",
  "org.python" % "jython-standalone" % "2.5.2" -> "com.google.guava" % "guava" % "15.0",
  "org.eclipse.birt.runtime" % "org.eclipse.osgi" % "3.9.1.v20130814-1242" -> "org.eclipse.birt.runtime" % "org.eclipse.osgi.services" % "3.3.100.v20130513-1956",

  "javax.mail" % "mail" % "1.4.1" -> "com.sun.mail" % "javax.mail" % "1.5.1"
)
                        
[error] (checkDuplicatedDependencies) Detected 424 conflict(s)
```

As suggested, the `checkDuplicatedExclude` setting can be used to ignore them.

###Implementation notes

Internally, it uses parallelism.  

It has been measured in a 4-core system and with a SSD disk, an improvement in time in a large app with 300 dependencies, from 229 seconds to 91 seconds.
